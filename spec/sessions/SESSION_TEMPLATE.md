> - **Hallucination Warning**: Never reference a file or line number that you have not explicitly verified via `read_file` or `list_dir` in the current session.
> - **How to use this directory (`spec/sessions/`)**: Read today's or the most recent day's log when starting a new conversation to quickly ingest the current daily state, established blockers, and past sessions for that day.
> - **How to update**: You must create a single file for each day (e.g., `DD-MMM-YY-topic.md`). Every newly created daily file MUST contain this exact LLM Context block and the `Unified Session Template` at the very top. As the day progresses, update the current active session while work is continuous. Create a new numbered session only when there is a meaningful time gap or restart of work, such as stopping in the morning and continuing 6 hours later.
>
> **Session boundary rule:** A session is a contiguous work block, not a single code edit or request. Do not create a new session for every task, fix, or verification pass. Append new facts to the active session's Completed, Decisions, and Open Blockers sections unless the work has clearly resumed after a substantial break.

## Unified Session Template

When appending to today's daily log, first decide whether the current work belongs to the active session. If it is the same continuous work block, update the existing session in place. If it follows a substantial break or restart, append a new session using this exact structure:

```markdown
# Session [N] — [Brief descriptor]

**Time:** [HH:MM-HH:MM] (Refer to AGENTS.md for Local Timezone & Format)

---

## Status at Session Start

[One paragraph outlining state at the start of the session: active sprint goals, backend sync state, and any carried regressions or blockers from the prior session.]

---

## Completed This Session

[Bullet list of concrete deliverables shipped, fixed, or closed. Keep adding to this list during the same contiguous work block.]

---

## Decisions Made

[Bullet list of decisions locked this session. Formal decisions must also be logged to the explicit Decision Log (DL-NNN) if an SDR or architectural log exists.]

---

## Open Blockers

[Numbered list of unresolved blockers with an owner. Strike through + date when resolved. Write "None" if clean.]
```

_(End of Template)_
